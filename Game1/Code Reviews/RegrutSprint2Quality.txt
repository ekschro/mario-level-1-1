KeyboardController.cs
Will Freeman

Correctly used the IController Interface to implement Keyboard Controller. The cyclomatic complexity is really high in the update method. The excessive branching is a code smell. Additional methods could be used for the if-else statements.
The implementation could easily support the change. All that needs to be done is the creation and implementation of helper methods.
