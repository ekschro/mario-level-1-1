This class was implemented by uses IBlockSprite Interface, this makes it easy to manage the blocks classes.
In the Draw method, have include colour parameter so we can easily change the color later if we need to.
There isn't any magic numbers in the class, so the implementation could be easily change. We can add more blocks and change its position easily in the Game1.cs
