MouseController.cs

Since this is a mouse controller, the fields containing just the 
	four cardinal directions as ICommand's already imply how the 
	class will operate. The fact that these fields are all 
	lowercase is slightly concerning, but otherwise fine.
The constructor simply initializes these four commands with their 
	respective commands from the classes that extend ICommand. 
	The commands are slightly vague, as it's not clear what is 
	going "Up" or "Down."
MouseController has a single method, Update, and by keeping the 
	class small it makes its purpose clearer.
The class gets the state of the mouse with a descriptive variable 
	"mouseState"
From there, there is an extended if-else statement which does 
	reduce some readability. It uses a field from a different
	class to perform its logic, which adds to the confusion.
	However, each path executes a single line of code, making
	it clear that this just determines which direction the Mario
	object is going.
