The file is clear and readable. 
Names conventions are good. Also using meaningful names for variable and methods, don't need comments to explain them.
Formatting are good, spacing were given to categorize different code.
All function simple with minimum of lines.
There are some methods don't have any implementation with it, I believe is because the question Block don't need that method.
