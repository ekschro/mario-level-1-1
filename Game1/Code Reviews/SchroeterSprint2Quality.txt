In the Draw method of this I noticed one small code smell.  Line 31 is pretty long and almost to the
point of being a 'God line'.  In order to shorten this line and lines like it arguments like
'(int)myGame.startingLocation.X' could first be saved to a shorter variable within the scope of the
method and then past as an argument.
