The class uses clear and straightforward fields based on their names
	The cycleLength and cyclePosition fields will clearly be 
	used in tandem, much like startFrame and endFrame
The Update method is simple and clean in demonstrating its 
cyclical sprite animation structure.
	Uses only 6 lines of code to clearly define the connection
	between the cycle fields and the frame fields
Draw method uses bare minimum without any "god lines"
	Uses some magic numbers; not entirely clear why these 
	specific numbers were used or for what intention
