This class uses the same cyclePosition and cycleLength variables as every other similar class, so this aids in consistency.
The Fireflower object stores its sprite, and only calls it to use its draw method and change its sprite when "Picked." This is not a great choice for a name, since it is not entirely clear what picked is, but this refers to the item being picked up.
The remaining functions are sufficient, with GameObjectLocation just returning the location of the object, and Update is a typical animation loop.
The choice of the names all fit, whether PascalCase or camelCase.
