This class is clear and readable. It have meaningful names for both variable and methods. 
Although it is a long class but it use different methods to load differnt object like enemy, block, pickups, camera settings.
However, there are some magic numbers in the methods. It is hard to understand what the number mean. For example, staticCamera = new CameraStatic(bossRoomLocation - 200); 
If all number are put in a utility class it will make the number be more meaningful when with variable names.
