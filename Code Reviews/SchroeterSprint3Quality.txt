The StarSprite class Draw method seems to share the same contents as the as the rest of the PickupItem/
Sprite/ classes.  I believe that this method could be defined in and inheirted from a more general class 
to avoid this redundant method body.  All else seems to pertain to the soley to StarSprite (high cohesion) 
and all methods seem to be concise and reasonably sized.
