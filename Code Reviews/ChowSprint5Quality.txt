This class is a long class, it contains too much line. It contain the collision respond between enemy, block, mario, pickup. However the logic is clear and has include much case for different respond.

It can be separate into different class. For example, EnemyCollisionRespondClass, BlockCollisionRespondClass, etc. By changing it into different class it is easier to manage and will be higher in cohesion.
