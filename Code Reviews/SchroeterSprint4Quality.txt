The cycilic complexity in this file is not bad, it never exceeds a degree of 2.  All methods seem to 
be only related to the Mario object and the all seem to have high cohesion. The Sprite Animation methods 
seem like they could have a better location elsewhere. The static fields have been eliminated since 
previous sprints which has lowered coupling for thei class greatly.
