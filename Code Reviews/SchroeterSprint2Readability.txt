This file is fairly readable. In fact, almost all methods contain at most one line of code.
The Draw method contains eleven lines which is still acceptable, but I'm not sure if they are
all necessary. Some lines don't seem to pertain to a the one frame 'crouching mario' sprite. 
I believe this was the result of reusing(copying) code from a another sprite file that he had
already written for Mario sprites in general. This can definitely be factored out when the code 
is refactored.
