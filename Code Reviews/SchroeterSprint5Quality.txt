There seems to be some things that are initialized for every call of draw that don't need to be
recreated and initialized with every call.  The countdown HUD counter logic seems like it lowers
the cohesion of the Draw method and could be moved to it's own method maybe in the PersistantData class. 
There are a number of 'magic' numbers in this class that could be made into constants.  The Update method 
seems to only handling some kind of animation logic.  I think that it should be responsible for updating 
the diplay with persistant data that can found in the PersistantData class.  The animation logic could 
then be moved to it's own private method within the class.
