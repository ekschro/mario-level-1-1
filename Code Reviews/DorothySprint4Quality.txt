This class was was under the interface of Iphysics which is a good idea of classifying different physics for enemy, mario, etc. In term of number of line in the whole class and each methods, it is pretty good, not too long. 
Also each if statement the complexity is not hight. 

Anything it can be change is can combine the xVelociy and yVelocity. Although currently separating two would still be fine.
