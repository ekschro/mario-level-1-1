This class has a few problems. First of all, it doesn't tag any of its fields as private, despite
them only being meant for use internally. Further, there are a significant number of magic
numbers, which may cause problems in maintainability. Just like in the Readability code review,
the class contains a lot of dead code which throws numerous NotImplementedExceptions, which may
cause problems. However, the actual code that is used is simple, straightforward, and low on 
cyclomatic complexity. It has dependenies on IEnemySprite, Game1, and FireEnemySprite, but only
uses Game1 to pass onto the FireEnemySprite, and the other two to call its Draw method, so 
coupling and cohesion for the useful code is low and high, respectively.
