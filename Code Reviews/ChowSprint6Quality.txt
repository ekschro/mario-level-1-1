Except from the Update and Draw method, others are relatively short and cohesive. The cycilic complexity of the class is not bad, the maximum is two.This class is also using the interface of Ilevel so it also make it more maintanable.
In terms of length, this class is long. However, this class loads all different gameobject, so it might be hard to reduce more lines. In addition, there are some magic numbers in the method, which if it can be all put inside a utility class, it will be better and make the number more meaningful.
