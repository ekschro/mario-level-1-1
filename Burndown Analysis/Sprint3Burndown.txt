Sprint 3 Analysis
Ericsson Schroeter

This sprint was a little trying for our team.  There were a lot of growing pains for our cade and as a group.  
Our initial implementation from Sprint 2 made the goals for Sprint 3 difficult to implement and required some 
rewriting and considieration before doing so.  The team as a whole seemed to have a lot going on in terms of 
other class work which made it difficult to complete in a orderly fashion ahead of time.

Unlike Sprint 2 the code was not written in a consistent fashion.  Though a lot of work and time was put into this 
sprint it was done in large bursts over the few weeks.  The burndown chart itself looks like a plateau because 
the tasks at hand weren't completely finished until shortly before the due date.  When something was suppossedly
completed issues would arise later from other changes or requirements implemented that would bar the team from
moving forward.

Though not perfect yet, communication between the group has gotten better.  Meeting in person has definetly proven 
to be the most effective way to work as a team.  All of this has been taken into consideration for the large amount
of goals in coming in Sprint 4.
