Sprint 6 
William Freeman

This Sprint was by far the most consistent in terms of work done over time. Looking at the Burndown chart,
it is somewhat misleading, since the days roll over at 8 PM. All tasks were completed at 10:19 PM, despite 
the chart saying otherwise. With this in mind, the tasks completed form almost a perfect slope, ideal for
the project.

This Sprint saw a significant amount of time spent cleaning up code that was either unneccesarily coupled
or simply just inefficient. However, tasks were performed at regular intervals, allowing plenty of time
to refactor as time allotted.

The communication in this group was the best it has ever been. People got all of their work done when they
said they would, everyone met up every day the week leading up to the submission, and there was never any
confusion as to what needed to be done or who was doing what. Overall, this Sprint showed just about the 
best that this group has to offer.
