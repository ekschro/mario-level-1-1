Sprint 4 Analysis
William Freeman

	This Sprint was definitely the most difficult for the team so far, with many tasks needing to be reworked and remade before a final implementation was solidified. This problem was amplified by having one group member out of the country. Furthermore, with massive restructuring of the code being commonplace, there was a significant amount of errors and confusion based on what could and could not be done with the "current" code.
	The Burndown chart has some flaws, but generally has a reasonable shape. Early on, it was underestimated how much work needed to be done, hence the occasional spike in the amount of work to be done, despite consistent commits daily. With the completion of the level and the general physics engine, a significant portion of tasks were moved to completion, hence the large drop on the 26th. Beyond that, problems began to set in, with commits still being made, but progress at somewhat of a standstill. While it should have been noted as progress beig slowly made, it wasn't until the day of the final implementation that tasks were finalized, but again, people failed to move their tasks into the completed section.
	During refactoring, a few key features that hadn't been implemented were added, such as Fireball logic, improved controls, and Koopa Shell logic, on top of general refactoring. Overall, despite problems and errors abound, this Sprint was tentatively a success, with all tasks completed by the final implementation.
